Low and High-Fidelity Prototypes: 

A change from previous sketches/mockups, is that I changed all of the radial button features to dropdown menus. I did this because it gives the user a cleaner look and easier use of the website. 
The low fidelity and mid fidelity prototypes have an edit button on the shopping cart, but the hi fi prototype only needs drop down selectors for easier editing of glaze and amount in the cart.
